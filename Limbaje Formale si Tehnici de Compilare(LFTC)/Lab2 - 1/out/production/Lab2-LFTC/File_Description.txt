The file that describes the finite automata is a txt file which contains:

1. states : a list of states separated by ","
        -example format  :   " states : q1,q2,q3"
2. alphabet : a string of supported characters
        - example format : "alphabet: abcdef"
        -it doesn't matter if the characters are repeated, because we store
            the alphabet as a set

3. initial_state: a state
        - example format: "initial_state : q0"

4. final_states : a list of states separated by ","
        - example format: "final_states: q0,q1"

5. transitions : multiple rows containing transitions of the form:
                    t(left_state, alphabet_literal) = result_state

         -example format : "transitions:
                            t(q0,a)=q1
                            t(q1,a)=q2"

example of FA:

states : q0,q1,q2
alphabet : abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
initial_state : q0
final_states : q2
transitions :
t(q0,a)=q1
t(q1,a)=q2
