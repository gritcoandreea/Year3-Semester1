States are represented as a set of Strings : Set<String>
-example : a state can be for example "q0" => set of states: (q1,q2,q3)
-I chose a set because the states must be unique , we cannot have two states with the same name in a FA

Initial states is represented as a String.

Final states are represented as a set of Strings : Set<String>
-example : a final state can be "q1" => set of states: (q1,q2)
-I chose a set because the final states must be unique , the same as the list of states.

A transition is an object which contains the left state of a transition, the symbol and the result state of a transition.
The list of transitions is represented as a set of transitions.
In this way we can store multiple transitions with the same leftState and symbol ( the case in which a FA is not deterministic).

The alphabet is represented as a set of symbols : Set<String>
A symbol is represented as a String, which is a character actually (my bad :) )
I chose String because I work all the time with string, but when I read from file I read character by character.

The alphabet is a collection of symbols which define a word, number, etc.
The alphabet is a collection of symbols which are an underlying base set for what we are trying to determine with our automata
,for example  a string,number, etc.
